# Burger

Burger (aka Eat-Da-Burger or, my personal version, Galaxy Burgers) is a web application for creating, displaying, and updating different types of burgers in a "restaurant counter" setting.
 
# How it Works
This project uses Express, Node, MySql, and an ORM.
Users (aka patrons) must install the NPM Packages used. All of the packages can be installed by typing "npm install" into the console.

# NPM Packages Used
. Express Handlebars (aka Handlebars)
. Body-Parser
. MySql
. Express

# How to Use it
Users can enter their own burger name and click the submit button to add it to the page. If you click "Devour It!", the burger will move over to the right side of the page to indicate that it has been devoured.
